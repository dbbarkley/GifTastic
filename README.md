What the project does:

Giftastic starts with ten buttons that I created. I went with a retro theme and all of my buttons are 80's arcade related. 
When a user clicks on a button, It makes an API call and gets ten giphy's and displays them. The user can create their own button and add it to the list. There's no limit on the number of buttons/API calls that a user can create. All giphy's that get pulled will have a rating no higher than PG.
